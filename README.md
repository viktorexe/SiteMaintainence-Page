# 🚧 Website Under Maintenance Page  

This project provides a simple yet elegant **"Under Maintenance"** page that can be used to notify visitors about ongoing updates or improvements to a website.  

## ✨ Features  

- **Modern Dark UI** with a glowing effect  
- **Maintenance Message** with an expected completion time  
- **Progress Indicator** to show update status  
- **Customizable Text & Icons**  
- **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop users  

## 🔧 How to Use  

1. Replace your website’s current `index.html` with the provided maintenance page code.
